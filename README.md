# TANDY Color Computer 1/2/3/Dragon MIDI Interface

V1 is a direct transcription of the original Rulaford MIDI interface design (that itself seems to be essentially a reference design used by almost all Motorola-bus systems of the day)
V2 switches out the 74ls90 for a 74ls161 counter (easier to source), but leaves the crystal design.  It also adds in some optional blinkenlights
V3 switches to a crystal oscillator and repurposes some of the now unused gates.
